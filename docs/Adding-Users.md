# Adding Users

Users in OpenGovMail are provisioned through the [Thunder ID](https://github.com/thunder-id/thunderid) console that ships with the platform. This guide walks through adding users via the console.

## Prerequisites

- OpenGovMail is running (see [Server Setup](../README.md#server-setup) in the main README).
- You can reach the Thunder console at `https://<your-domain>:8090/console`.
- You have Thunder admin credentials.

## Steps

### 1. Sign in to the Thunder console

Open `https://<your-domain>:8090/console` in your browser and sign in with your admin credentials.

### 2. Create a user schema

Define a user schema that includes the fields needed for an email user — at minimum, `username` and `password`.

### 3. Assign the schema to an organization unit

Assign the schema you just created to the organization unit you want the users to belong to.

### 4. Add users

Under the target organization unit, add users using one of the following:

- **Set a password directly** — supply a `username` and `password` for the user.
- **Send an invitation link** — provide the user's secondary email address; Thunder will email them an invitation link to set their own password.
