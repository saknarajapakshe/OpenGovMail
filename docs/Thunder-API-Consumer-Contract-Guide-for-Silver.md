# Thunder API Consumer Contract Guide for OpenGovMail

## Overview

This document describes the Thunder APIs OpenGovMail depends on through its provisioning and bootstrap scripts.
It is a consumer contract, not a full provider API documentation set.

Use this together with the OpenAPI consumer spec to:

- document exactly what OpenGovMail uses,
- detect breaking changes early,
- define a clear change-notification process.

## Scope

In scope:

- APIs called from `scripts/thunder/01-default-resources.sh`.
- APIs called from `scripts/thunder/02-sample-resources.sh`.
- Only request/response fields OpenGovMail scripts actually send, parse, or branch on.

Out of scope:

- Thunder endpoints not called by these scripts.
- Response fields OpenGovMail does not read.
- Internal helper implementation details not visible in these script files.

## Integration Flows

### 1) Default platform bootstrap flow

- Creates default organization unit.
- Creates default user schema.
- Creates admin user.
- Creates system resource server and hierarchical resources/actions.
- Creates administrator role and assignment.

### 2) Flow inventory and flow ID resolution

- Lists existing authentication, registration, and user-onboarding flows.
- Resolves flow IDs by handle for later application configuration.

### 3) Application bootstrap flow

- Creates DEVELOP application with OAuth2 inbound auth configuration.
- Creates sample SPA Email App application with OAuth2 inbound auth configuration.
- Falls back to application list query when app already exists.

### 4) Optional design and localization bootstrap flow

- Creates themes from local JSON files.
- Seeds translations by language.

## Common Protocol Expectations

- Authorization scheme for protected management endpoints: Bearer token (provided by shared helper).
- Content-Type for JSON POST requests: application/json.
- OpenGovMail scripts call Thunder over HTTPS-compatible base URL settings.

## Breaking Change Policy

The following are breaking for OpenGovMail provisioning unless coordinated:

- Remove or rename any endpoint listed in this guide.
- Change HTTP method of any listed endpoint.
- Remove request fields OpenGovMail sends for successful create operations.
- Remove or rename response fields OpenGovMail parses (`id`, `handle`, `identifier`, `client_id`, `totalResults`, and admin username-containing user attributes where used).
- Change semantic meaning of `handle`, `identifier`, `client_id`, or role assignment shape such that OpenGovMail cannot match existing resources.
- Change duplicate-resource signaling behavior without preserving currently handled statuses/patterns (`409`; and specific `400` duplicate-app patterns where currently relied on).
- Return non-success for list lookups used as fallback recovery (`/users`, `/applications`, `/resource-servers`, flow list endpoints).

Non-breaking examples:

- Add optional response fields.
- Add new endpoints OpenGovMail does not call.
- Add optional request fields with backward-compatible defaults.

## Change Notification Process

Before a breaking change, Thunder should share:

- change summary,
- updated OpenAPI consumer contract,
- sample request/response payloads,
- migration notes,
- rollout timeline.

Recommended lead time: 30 days minimum for breaking changes.

## Verification Strategy

OpenGovMail uses this guide and the OpenAPI consumer spec to:

- validate bootstrap behavior in integration/setup tests,
- detect schema and behavior drift,
- block releases on contract-breaking changes for provisioning paths.

## Ownership

- Consumer: OpenGovMail team
- Provider: Thunder team
- Source of truth: docs folder and consumer OpenAPI spec in OpenGovMail repository

## Versioning

Suggested model:

- Major: breaking changes
- Minor: backward-compatible additions
- Patch: editorial updates

Current version: 1.0.0
