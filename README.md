**OpenGovMail** aims to build a new kind of email and communication system that can work at a government scale. The goal is to make email faster, smarter, and easier to manage while keeping it secure and reliable. The platform will evolve in two stages: Version 1.0 delivers reliable, standards-compliant email, while Version 2.0 reimagines communication with modern collaboration at its core.

## Why OpenGovMail?
OpenGovMail is designed to be secure, reliable, and easy to manage. It runs entirely on your own hardware, giving you full control over your data and ensuring privacy. The system is lightweight and efficient, performing well even on minimal hardware, which makes it easy to deploy in a variety of environments. Each user has a single, unified identity, so an email address and user identity are seamlessly connected. You can bring your own identity provider or use Thunder to organize your users and map your organization hierarchically.

External firewalls are not required to filter emails, and attachments are stored separately in blob storage to save space and improve overall system performance. OpenGovMail also includes built-in observability, allowing administrators to monitor activity, detect issues early, and maintain smooth operation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A dedicated Linux server with a static public IP address. You also require root access and port access control.
- Domain with DNS control

### Minimum hardware requirements
- 4GB of memory

### Software 
- Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux) and [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed
  
### DNS setup
You own <a>example.com</a> and want to send an email as person@example.com.

You will need to add a few records to your DNS control panel.

> [!Note]
> Replace example.com and 12.34.56.78 in the below example with your domain and ip address.

| DNS Record | Name        | Value                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| A          | mail        | 12.34.56.78                                            |
| A          | example.com | 12.34.56.78                                            |
| MX         | example.com | mail.example.com                                       |
| TXT        | example.com | "v=spf1 ip4:12.34.56.78 ~all"                          |
| TXT        | _dmarc      | "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com" |
| PTR        | 12.34.56.78 | mail.example.com                                       |

> [!Tip]
> PTR records are usually set through your hosting provider. 

### Server Setup
-  Use the below command to clone the OpenGovMail Repo and navigate to the OpenGovMail folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenGovMail/OpenGovMail.git
cd OpenGovMail
```

### Configuration
- Open [`opengovmail.yaml`](https://github.com/OpenGovMail/OpenGovMail/blob/main/conf/opengovmail.yaml) with a text editor.

- Enter your domain name.

- Create your own environment file from the template and fill in the values before running setup:

```bash
cp services/.env.example services/.env
nano services/.env
```

- Follow the manual setup instructions in the [SeaweedFS README](https://github.com/OpenGovMail/OpenGovMail/blob/main/services/seaweedfs/README.md) to create the `.env` and `s3-config.json` files.

- Run `bash scripts/setup/setup.sh` to set up the configs.

- Run `bash scripts/service/start-opengovmail.sh` to start the mail server.

- Replace the dkim record below with the output you get after running the `start-opengovmail.sh` script

| DNS Record | Name            | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TXT        | mail._domainkey | "v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDYZd3CAas0+81zf13cvtO6o0+rlGx8ZobYQXRR9W8qcJOeO1SiQGx8F4/DjZE1ggujOaY1bkt8OnUg7vG7/bk5PNe05EHJrg344krodqCJrVI74ZzEB77Z1As395KX6/XqbQxBepQ8D5+RpGFOHitI443G/ZWgZ6BRyaaE6t3u0QIDAQAB" |

> [!Important] 
> Ensure that your dkim value is correctly formatted.

### Adding users

Users in OpenGovMail are provisioned through the [Thunder ID](https://github.com/thunder-id/thunderid) console that ships with the platform. Sign in to the console at `https://<your-domain>:8090/console` with your admin credentials.
- To add more users to your email server, open up [`users.yaml`](https://github.com/OpenGovMail/OpenGovMail/blob/main/conf/users.yaml), and add their usernames and run the following command.

For the full walkthrough — creating a user schema, assigning it to an organization unit, and adding users via direct password or invitation link — see [Adding Users](docs/Adding-Users.md).

### Testing your setup
- Now that you have a working email server, you can test your configuration using the following links/scripts.

  - [mxtoolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx)
    - MxToolbox is a powerful online service that provides a suite of free diagnostic and lookup tools for troubleshooting email delivery, DNS, and network issues.
  - [mail-tester](https://www.mail-tester.com/)
    - Mail-Tester is a free online tool that analyzes the "spamminess" of your email and server configuration, providing a score out of 10 to help improve your email deliverability.
  

- You can also set up a Mail User Agent (MUA) like Thunderbird to send and receive emails. Follow the instructions in [Mail User Agent Setup](docs/Mail-User-Agent-Setup.md).
